The advent of ride-sharing platforms such as Uber, Ola, and Lyft has revolutionized
urban mobility by providing on-demand transportation solutions that are both accessible
and affordable. These platforms allow individuals to share rides, thereby reducing traffic
congestion, lowering costs, and providing an alternative to traditional taxi services.
However, one of the major issues that these platforms face is the imbalance between
supply and demand, which can result in long wait times for customers and low efficiency
for drivers.
The goal is to equip ride-sharing businesses with data-driven insights that enhance
operational decisions, increase driver allocation efficiency, and improve user
satisfaction. By analyzing historical and real-time datasets—including weather reports,
traffic patterns, event schedules, and ride request data—this solution provides
stakeholders with a visual dashboard to monitor demand fluctuations. Ultimately, this
predictive approach can help optimize pricing, reduce downtime, and offer a better
experience for both drivers and passengers, making ride-sharing more sustainable and
efficient
