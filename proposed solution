The rapid growth of ride-sharing services has introduced new challenges in managing
rider demand and driver allocation. Traditional systems often operate reactively, lacking
tools to predict high-demand periods or zones. This unpredictability leads to long wait times,
underutilized drivers, and customer dissatisfaction. The absence of data-driven forecasting
limits operational efficiency and revenue optimization. With increasing variables such as
weather, traffic, and events impacting demand, there is a critical need for a system that can
analyze these patterns and provide actionable insights. Identifying and solving this gap is
essential to improve service reliability and enhance urban mobility outcomes.
