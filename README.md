Uber-Trip-Analysis

This project showcases a Power BI-based interactive dashboard designed to forecast ride-sharing demand using a combination of historical ride data and real-time external data sources like weather and event information. Built as part of an academic capstone under the B.Tech. in AI & Data Science program, the solution brings together business intelligence, data integration, and time-series forecasting to optimize urban mobility strategies.

üîç Features

- Dynamic Forecasting: Predicts hourly and zonal ride demand using historical trends, weather, and event patterns.
- Interactive Dashboards: Visual elements include KPI cards, time-series graphs, heatmaps, and demand filters for deep dive analysis.
- Power BI & DAX Integration: Utilizes Power Query for ETL and DAX for advanced calculations like peak hour detection and rolling averages.
- Role-Based Views: Row-Level Security (RLS) restricts data access for Admins, Drivers, and Analysts with tailored insights.
- Live Map & Geo-Analytics: Highlights demand distribution across urban zones with spatial heatmaps.
- Security-Aware Architecture: Implements data privacy practices and secure API integrations for external data fetches.

üß∞ Technical Tools Used:

- Microsoft Power BI Desktop
- Power Query Editor
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
- OpenWeatherMap API (Weather Forecasts)
- CSV-based synthetic and open ride data


 üìà Outcomes

- Enhanced decision-making for resource allocation in ride-sharing.
- Reduced driver idle time and optimized route planning.
- Scalable and low-code solution for urban mobility platforms.

 üöÄ Future Enhancements

- Integration with real-time streaming datasets (Azure Stream Analytics).
- Advanced ML-based forecasting (ARIMA, LSTM).
- Mobile-friendly dashboard & driver push notifications.
- IoT integration for fleet tracking.
